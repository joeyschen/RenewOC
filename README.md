# RenewOC, for www.renewchurchoc.com
Dev Server: www.joeyshchen.com



This is a church website that I creating for Renew OC. I am changing it from a squarespace template into a Bootstrap templated Parallax website. The starting page has a video background. 

This website is mostly for people who are looking for a new church and want to understand what Renew is all about. It has very simple functionality, including signing up as a new-comer and asking for a newsletter.

The types of technology used are:
-HTML/CSS(LESS)/Javascript (Jquery)
-Bootstrap 4 Alpha
-PHP
